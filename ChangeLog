  Add nickname grouping. Nickname grouping allows users to
  register multiple nicks to one account. Each nick has
  its own registered and last seen times but all other
  data is shared (accounts also have their own registered
  and last seen times).
  Nickname grouping works together with ACCESS, ENFORCE,
  GHOST.
  The DROP command drops entire accounts; the UNGROUP
  command must be used to drop single nicks.
  Some missing bits: administrator UNGROUP, expiry of single nicks

  Add experimental code which uses the normal command_t's
  for fantasy commands, allowing complete removal of
  fcommand later. Uses lines starting with '!', removing
  the '!' to get the command name. Adds the channel name
  before the arguments. There is a special case for
  '.flags'.

  Add get_source_name(), get_source_mask() and get_oper_name().
  These generate a name for a sourceinfo.
  The general idea is that get_source_name() and
  get_oper_name() are just a nick in the normal case
  where the user is logged in to an account with the
  same name as their nick, and get_source_mask() is
  nick!user@vhost. Somewhat longer results apply in
  other cases.

  (char *nick, char *ser, char *host, char *real, char *uid)

  This simplifies the code slightly and makes it possible

  For example, the nickTS sent out is now consistent with
  our record of it.

  Add two extra parameters to pcommand_add(), the minimum
  number of parameters and the allowed source types
  (before SERVER, user, server).
  Violations of this are logged at INFO level and the
  m_function is not called. So most code that checks
  for user/server or parc can be removed from m_functions
  (later commit).
  This facility should only be used for protocol violations,
  not things that can legitimately happen.
  This commit also repairs solidircd m_svhost().

  Remove extern.h and everything except the #includes in
  atheme.h, moving the contents to two new header files
  global.h and tools.h.
  The material has been reordered and some comments have
  been added.
  To compile after this it is necessary to run make depend
  (or wait after next commit).

  Add support for CIDR channel bans/exceptions and akills.
  src/cidr.c provides match_ips() for matching a CIDR mask
  against an IP address and match_cidr() for channel bans
  (with nick!user@). In accordance with match(), zero is
  returned for a match, non-zero otherwise. The code is
  mostly taken from ratbox but modified to eliminate OS
  dependency for IPv6.
  CIDR is checked whether the ircd supports it or not.
  ChanServ RECOVER used to only check host and vhost matches
  for the implied unban but now also checks ip match and
  CIDR.

  Exception is SIGUSR1 (out of memory) as we cannot safely
  return from there. So there we try (in a hackish way) to
  notify the network and log files (using write(2)) and
  abort(3) the process.

  Make it possible for a module init function to indicate failure
  (m->mflags = MODTYPE_FAIL). If this happens the module will be
  unloaded without calling the deinit function.
  Added a macro MODULE_USE_SYMBOL to call module_locate_symbol()
  and abort the module load on failure.
  Other changes: the loaded module is now not in the modules list
  when modinit is called, wallops/log for depending modules unload
  in reverse order.

  Put netwide EOB support in the core (a few protocol modules
  already used this internally). This allows distinguishing
  between existing users coming back from a netsplit and new
  users. This adds a new hook server_eob with parameter
  server_t *s.
  
  P10 and ircnet use the protocol's specific burst detection,
  the others emulate it using PING/PONG. Note that in some
  protocols the burst detection only works locally, so it is
  not useful here.

  Log:
  Remove the broken nickname linking system.
  
  Rationale:
  
  The implementation doesn't really work right, links basically only
  work for channel access and /ns ghost. Still it complicates things
  quite a lot.
  
  Considering we have identify as, and changing nicks does not log you
  out from services, the only use for nickname linking is allowing
  people to /ns ghost multiple nicks under one account. For that, they
  could also create multiple accounts instead (which requires keeping them
  all in use).
  
  Another argument is that, in practice, many people do not understand how
  linking works, so they don't use it.
  
  So I propose removing nickname linking.
  
  Multiple nicks per account might come back later with a
  ratbox-services-style nickserv (account name has no relationship to
  nicks, account has zero or more nicks associated with it).

  Log:
  - Use +l 1 instead of +b *!*@* to prevent users rejoining
    during the masskick. Escapes to +l are generally rarer
    than ban exceptions, also this avoids potential loss
    of the banlist on P10.
  - If the requester is not on channel, make sure the
    channel is fully cleared out (so it is destroyed
    if not marked with a permanent cmode).

  Add per-channel flags templates. Templates can be specified
  in the flags command, avoiding the need to memorize
  complicated flags strings. Templates are manipulated with
  the TEMPLATE command which is similar to the FLAGS command.
  The xOP levels can also be used as templates.
  
  For example: /msg chanserv flags #chan *!*@*.good.com VOP
  
  All template entries must fit in a single metadata entry,
  private:templates. This is fairly ugly string manipulation.
  
  The TEMPLATE command module needs to be enabled in the
  configuration file.

  - Send channel notices from the server instead of from chanserv if
    chanserv is not on channel, in order that they won't be blocked
  - If chanserv is not on channel, join briefly to set the topic.
    This is annoying but there is really no other way.

  Log:
  Force users to log in before using NS VERIFY. This is not strictly necessary but helps avoid leaking information about pending authorizations (for example, a user can't see that another user's registration has not been verified or that they have a pending e-mail change).

  Log:
  Don't let users change their e-mail address before they perform the initial verification. Prevents the following attack: malicious user registers evil1 with e-mail address innocent@user.com, uses /NS SET EMAIL evil@evil.com, and then uses the key to verify the initial registration (instead of the subsequent e-mail change). If we add more verification points in the future, we may want to have a 'key type' property.
