1. CREDITS
----------

Atheme was originally based on Shrike, however, this has almost all been
rewritten now. Atheme has also borrowed some code from Sentinel.

Information about Shrike can be found at http://shrike.malkier.net/.
Information about Sentinel can be found at http://ircd.botbay.net/sentinel/.

2. PRESENTATION
---------------

Atheme is a set of Services for IRC networks that allows users to
manage their channels in a secure and efficient way and allows operators to
manage various things about their networks. Unlike it's predecessor, Shrike,
Atheme has a completely reworked form of channel management that feels somewhat
like eggdrop and is somewhat more useful.

Atheme currently works with many irc daemons. More details are available
in the config file.

Internally, Atheme shares more similarities with ircd than it does with 
IRCServices. Anope/Epona, Cygnus, OperStats, Hybserv, Theia, etc are all 
based on IRCServices and as such have very old legacy code that none of 
the authors, except Church truly understand. Atheme was written 
completely from scratch with the more complex concepts taken from 
various modern ircd packages, including ircu, ircd-ratbox, hybrid and 
bahamut.

3. INSTALLATION
---------------

See the INSTALL file.

4. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
-----------------------

Normally, Atheme can be run simply by invoking the "atheme" executable.  Atheme
will then use the defaults specified in the configuraiton file and connect
to the specified uplink server. Alternatively, any of the following
command-line options can be specified to change the default behavior:

  -c </path/to/file> - specify the configuration file
  -d                 - start in debugging mode
  -h                 - print the help message and exit
  -n                 - do not fork into the background
  -v                 - print the version information and exit

Atheme also handles the following signals:
  HUP  - force a REHASH
  INT  - force a RESTART
  TERM - force a SHUTDOWN

Upon starting, Atheme will parse its command-line arguments, open its log file,
parse its configuration file, load its database, connect to the uplink,
and (assuming -n is not specified) detach into the background.  If Atheme
encounters an error while parsing the configuration or database files it will
terminate immediately. Otherwise, it will run until killed or otherwise stopped.

5. GETTING SUPPORT
------------------

If you are stuck, or services are doing something really weird, or you have
some sort of brilliant idea, we have a channel on IRC! (Surprising, no?)
To access this channel, connect to irc.atheme.org, and join #atheme.

There are also community forums and a community-oriented module 
repository located at http://modules.atheme.org/.

6. REPORTING BUGS
-----------------

If you find a bug in Atheme, you must report it via the bugtracker; our
developers have a tendency to forget things. Your bug is not actually a
bug until it's reported.
