Help for DROP:

DROP allows you to "unregister" a registered nickname
provided you have the correct password.

Once you DROP a nickname -- all of the data
associated with it (access lists, etc) are gone and
cannot be restored.

Syntax: DROP <nickname> <password>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DROP foo bar
