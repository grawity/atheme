Atheme 0.1 Release Notes
========================

- Dancer/Hyperion IRCd support is marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.
- Chunky Monkey IRCd is also marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.
- NickServ support is experimental. We would like suggestions on how to improve it.
  If you would like to use it, you should use the example-traditional.conf file,
  instead of the example.conf. This will set up a logical environment for NickServ to
  operate in.
- InspIRCd support passes our regression tests, however, we would like feedback
  concerning how well it works. Features added by optional modules are not supported
  at this time. You will need the m_services.so module loaded to make things work
  100% properly.
- UnrealIRCd support is implemented fairly well, but not all features are supported.
- Bahamut 1.8 support has not been tested against 1.8.4, though it is expected that
  1.8.4 should work fine.
- TSora IRCd support (ratbox) does not support TS6, and probably never will.

If you need help, drop by OSCN and ask:
   irc.oscnet.org #oscn-dev

Thanks!
