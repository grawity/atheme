1. CREDITS
----------

While Atheme isn't directly based on any other program it borrows a decent
amount of code from Cygnus, Sentinel and Shrike.

Information about Shrike can be found at http://shrike.malkier.net/.
Information about Cygnus can be found at http://www.habber.net/services/.
Information about Sentinel can be found at http://ircd.botbay.net/sentinel/.

Files that we didn't write most of:
  src/balloc.c, this was stolen from ircd-ratbox.
  src/confp.c, this was stolen from Sentinel (from csircd).
  src/event.c, this was stolen from ircd-ratbox.
  src/match.c, this was stolen from Sentinel (from IRCnet ircd).

2. PRESENTATION
---------------

Atheme is a set of services for TSora-based IRC networks that allows users to
manage their channels in a secure and efficient way and allows operators to
manage various things about their networks. Unlike it's predecessor, Shrike,
Atheme has a completely reworked form of channel management that feels somewhat
like eggdrop and is somewhat more useful.

Atheme currently works with:
  ircd-ratbox 1.3 and 2.x in TS5              | via the ratbox ircd type
  ircd-hybrid 7.0 or later                    | via the ratbox ircd type
  ircd-hybrid 6.0 or later                    | via the ratbox ircd type
  csircd 1.3 or later                         | via the ratbox ircd type
  Bahamut 1.8 or later                        | via the bahamut ircd type
  UnrealIRCd 3.1 or later                     | via the unreal ircd type *

* UnrealIRCd support is quite lacking right now, and is most likely unacceptable
  for a production network.

3. INSTALLATION
---------------

See the INSTALL file.

4. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
-----------------------

Normally, Atheme can be run simply by invoking the "atheme" executable.  Atheme
will then use the defaults specified in the configuraiton file and connect
to the specified uplink server. Alternatively, any of the following
command-line options can be specified to change the default behavior:

  -c </path/to/file> - specify the configuration file
  -d                 - start in debugging mode
  -h                 - print the help message and exit
  -n                 - do not fork into the background
  -v                 - print the version information and exit

Atheme also handles the following signals:
  HUP  - force a REHASH
  INT  - force a RESTART
  TERM - force a SHUTDOWN

Upon starting, Atheme will parse its command-line arguments, open its log file,
parse its configuration file, load its database, connect to the uplink,
and (assuming -n is not specified) detach into the background.  If Atheme
encounters an error while parsing the configuration or database files it will
terminate immediately. Otherwise, it will run until killed or otherwise stopped.

5. GETTING SUPPORT
------------------

If you are stuck, or services are doing something really wierd, or you have
some sort of brilliant idea, we have a channel on IRC! (Surprising, no?)
To access this channel, connect to irc.oscnet.org, and join #oscn-dev.
