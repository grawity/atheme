Help for KICKBAN:

The KICKBAN command allows for the removal of an abusive user from
a channel. Unlike the KICK command, a ban is placed on the abusive
user after he is removed from the channel.

Syntax: KICKBAN <#channel> <nick> [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& KICKBAN #foo abuser
    /msg &nick& KICKBAN #foo abuser go away
