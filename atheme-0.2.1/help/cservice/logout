Help for LOGOUT:

LOGOUT logs you out of services so that you
can log into another username or whatever else
melts your butter. Note that you are automatically
logged out when you sign off.

If the last two parameters are present it will
logout whomever is currently logged in as the
supplied username.

Syntax: LOGOUT [username] [password]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& LOGOUT
    /msg &nick& LOGOUT foo bar
