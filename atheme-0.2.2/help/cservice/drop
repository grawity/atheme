Help for DROP:

DROP allows you to "unregister" a registered username
or channel provided you have the correct password.

Once you DROP a username or channel all of the data
associated with it (access lists, etc) are gone and
cannot be restored.

Syntax: DROP <username|#channel> <password>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DROP foo bar
    /msg &nick& DROP #foo bar
