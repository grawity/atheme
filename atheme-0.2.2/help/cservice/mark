Help for MARK:

MARK allows operators to attach a note to a username
or channel. For example, an operator could mark the
nickname of a spammer so that others know the user
has previously been warned.

MARK information will be displayed in INFO output.

Syntax: MARK <username|#channel> ON|OFF <reason>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& MARK #lobby ON Takeover: returned to bill
    /msg &nick& MARK game_boy ON Persistent spammer
    /msg &nick& MARK nenolod OFF
