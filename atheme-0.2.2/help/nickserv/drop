Command - DROP
Usage   - DROP <nickname> <password>
  
Using this command makes NickServ stop watching your nick, and
will remove it from services' database. If a nick is dropped,
anyone else can register it. You must use the NickServ
IDENTIFY command before doing this.  Use the command
with the nickname as the only argument.  

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DROP foo bar
