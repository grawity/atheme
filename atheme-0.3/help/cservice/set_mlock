Help for SET MLOCK:

MLOCK (or "mode lock") allows you to enforce a set
of modes on a channel.  This can prevent abuse in cases
such as +kl. It can also make it harder to fight evil
bots, be careful.

Syntax: SET <#channel> MLOCK <modes>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& SET #foo MLOCK +nt-ilpksm
    /msg &nick& SET #foo MLOCK +nt
    /msg &nick& SET #foo MLOCK -kl
    /msg &nick& SET #foo MLOCK OFF
