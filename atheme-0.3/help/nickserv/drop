Command - DROP
Usage   - DROP <nickname> <password>
  
Using this command makes NickServ stop watching your nick, and
will remove it from services' database. If a nick is dropped,
anyone else can register it. You will also lose all your channel
access and memos. You must use the NickServ IDENTIFY command
before doing this.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DROP foo bar
