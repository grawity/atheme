Help for FREEZE:

FREEZE allows operators to "freeze" an abusive user's
account. When an operator freezes a account, the user
can no longer log in to the account. This prevents
any access to be gained.

FREEZE information will be displayed in INFO output.

Syntax: FREEZE <acccount> ON|OFF <reason>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& FREEZE pfish ON Persistent spammer
    /msg &nick& FREEZE alambert OFF
