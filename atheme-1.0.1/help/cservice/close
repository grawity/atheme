Help for CLOSE:

CLOSE prevents a channel from being used. Anyone
who enters is immediately kickbanned. The channel
cannot be dropped and foundership cannot be
transferred.

Use CLOSE OFF to reopen a channel. While closed,
channels will still expire.

Syntax: CLOSE <#channel> <ON|OFF> [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& CLOSE #lamers ON spamming
    /msg &nick& CLOSE #spiderslair OFF
