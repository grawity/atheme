Command - DROP
Usage   - DROP <account> <password>
  
Using this command removes your account from services' database.
You will lose all your channel access and memos. You need to log
in to services before doing this.  

When dropping and reregistering an account during a netsplit,
users on the other side of the split may later be recognized
as the new account.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DROP foo bar
