  Backport trunk r4881 and r4883:
  - Move akill checking into a user_add hook function in
    modules/operserv/akill.c
  - Do not send klines for akills that have already expired
  - Match IP as well as host against akills (no CIDR currently)
  - Example conf files: change "AKILL command" to "AKILL system"
    since akills are now completely disabled if operserv/akill 
    is not loaded.

  Add support for P10 host hiding with umode +x (<account>.<suffix>).
  The suffix needs to be set in serverinfo::hidehostsuffix
  (the server does not tell us that information in time).
  Also another user_t flag is necessary because setting +x is also
  possible before logging in and it will then apply on login.

  users on that server. Asuka has some bugs where it sends out
  +D-d or +d-D to servers, but that's ok.

  - Inspircd r2882 clears umode +r on nick change, so we can use this.

  Remove the broken nickname linking system.
  
  Rationale:
  
  The implementation doesn't really work right, links basically only
  work for channel access and /ns ghost. Still it complicates things
  quite a lot.
  
  Considering we have identify as, and changing nicks does not log you
  out from services, the only use for nickname linking is allowing
  people to /ns ghost multiple nicks under one account. For that, they
  could also create multiple accounts instead (which requires keeping them
  all in use).
  
  Another argument is that, in practice, many people do not understand how
  linking works, so they don't use it.
  
  So I propose removing nickname linking.
  
  Multiple nicks per account might come back later with a
  ratbox-services-style nickserv (account name has no relationship to
  nicks, account has zero or more nicks associated with it).

  - Use +l 1 instead of +b *!*@* to prevent users rejoining
    during the masskick. Escapes to +l are generally rarer
    than ban exceptions, also this avoids potential loss
    of the banlist on P10.
  - If the requester is not on channel, make sure the
    channel is fully cleared out (so it is destroyed
    if not marked with a permanent cmode).

  Change uplink configuration handling a bit.
  Before rehashing, mark everything "illegal".
  If the rehash fails, remove the "illegal" marks and continue.
  When adding uplinks, allow replacing an "illegal" one.
  If the rehash succeeds, remove all uplinks marked "illegal"
  except the current uplink.
  When losing connection to the current uplink, if it is
  marked "illegal", delete it. If that was the last uplink,
  exit.

  Add per-channel flags templates. Templates can be specified
  in the flags command, avoiding the need to memorize
  complicated flags strings. Templates are manipulated with
  the TEMPLATE command which is similar to the FLAGS command.
  The xOP levels can also be used as templates.
  
  For example: /msg chanserv flags #chan *!*@*.good.com VOP
  
  All template entries must fit in a single metadata entry,
  private:templates. This is fairly ugly string manipulation.
  
  The TEMPLATE command module needs to be enabled in the
  configuration file.

  - Send channel notices from the server instead of from chanserv if
    chanserv is not on channel, in order that they won't be blocked
  - If chanserv is not on channel, join briefly to set the topic.
    This is annoying but there is really no other way.

  Force users to log in before using NS VERIFY. This is not strictly necessary but helps avoid leaking information about pending authorizations (for example, a user can't see that another user's registration has not been verified or that they have a pending e-mail change).

  Don't let users change their e-mail address before they perform the initial verification. Prevents the following attack: malicious user registers evil1 with e-mail address innocent@user.com, uses /NS SET EMAIL evil@evil.com, and then uses the key to verify the initial registration (instead of the subsequent e-mail change). If we add more verification points in the future, we may want to have a 'key type' property.
