Atheme 1.0.2 Release Notes
==========================
- Several UserServ bugfixes.
- InspIRCd improvements.
- Ensure kline exempt fully exempts from akills; do not kill akilled users
  at any time.
- Avoid sending out klines with negative expiry time.
- Add IP glob akill matching, for ircds that send user IP addresses.
- Move akill checking to operserv/akill module.
- Several other minor tweaks and bugfixes.

Atheme 1.0.1 Release Notes
==========================
- Don't allocate me.name/me.numeric on rehash. This fixes a known P10
  issue.
- Add support for ircu2.10.12's +D mode, which was already implemented
  in Asuka.
- Always send both the channel TS and the topic TS when setting a topic
  under P10 ircd's.
- Several other minor tweaks and bugfixes.

Atheme 1.0 Release Notes
========================
- Add ability to use =<nick> where accounts are used. (it aliases to the
  User's account).
- Deop users recreating registered channels if they do not have op flags.
  This attempts not to affect channels created longer ago.
- Add separate protocol module for ircd-hybrid, with CHGHOST support.
- Add ircd name to /version output.
- Add atheme.account.vhost XMLRPC for setting and removing vhosts. Note
  that this, unlike the other XMLRPCs, allows things that the given
  credentials would not normally (over IRC) be allowed to.
- Remove the incomplete and cluttering nickname linking system (this was
  actually done in 1.0rc1, but we forgot to mention it).

Atheme 1.0rc1 Release Notes
===========================
- Add capabilities to protocol modules:
  - forced nick change (aka SVSNICK)
  - invite
  - channel op notice (aka WALLCHOPS)
- Don't unkline temp akills if they have already expired.
- AKILL wildcard checking changed to ratbox algorithm.
- Further simplification of access checking.
- Hostmask access entries now check vhost, not host. This means services
  cloaks now work in access lists.
- InspIRCd module updated to beta6 and above (tree linking instead of mesh).
- For akicks, use a matching +b'ed hostmask if possible.
- For ircds with dalnet-like +r umodes, don't set it for userserv.
- Add /cs forcexop to reset access levels to xOP values. Useful if CA_?OP
  are changed.
- Make CA_?OP configurable in atheme.conf.
- Add channel_info hook on /cs info.
- Add per-channel flags templates. Templates can be specified in the flags
  command, avoiding the need to memorize complicated flags strings.
  Templates are manipulated with the TEMPLATE command which is similar to the
  FLAGS command.  The xOP levels can also be used as templates.
- Add per-channel fantasy command disable.
- Fix NEVEROP and NOOP options.
- If fantasy commands are globally disabled, mark services clients as "deaf"
  for some ircds.
- Add /cs set verbose ops, works like /cs set verbose on but only shows to
  channel ops.
- Allow users to remove their own access from channels (except akicks of
  course).
- Some improvements to network I/O.
- Add support for permanent (+P) channels in charybdis/hyperion/shadowircd.
- Add support for more FHS-like paths (not really complete but should still
  be helpful for packagers).
- Add fine grained services operator privileges. IRCops get certain
  privileges, and registered accounts can be granted privileges. This
  works via atheme.conf. You will need to redo the operator part of your
  configuration. See the new example.conf and doc/PRIVILEGES for more
  information.
- Add message translation support.
- /cs voice/halfop/op now notifies the target user who did it.
- /cs flags mentions who gave the command in the verbose notice.
- Remove many redundant confirming notices.
- Regardless of join_chans/leave_chans, join chanserv temporarily to
  channels which would otherwise be empty to enforce akick or staffonly.
- Add nickserv enforcement (FNC users who do not identify in time) to
  contrib.
- Drastically improve P10 support.
- Add solidircd support.
- Add support for ban exceptions and other ban-like modes.
- Remove possibilities to log in to accounts without password by changing
  nick during a netsplit on an ircd that does not clear +r (or similar) on
  nick changes.
- Various minor tweaks and bugfixes.

Atheme 0.3 Release Notes
========================
- All services have been entirely modularized. You will need to
  redo your configuration. An authentication service has been
  added (choose from either NickServ or UserServ,) for
  UserServ you should use example.userserv.conf.
- The way modules work has been changed almost entirely. Please try
  loading bad modules especially on macintosh and AIX systems, thanks!
  (Report any negative findings to the tracker.)
- The way sockets work has also changed entirely. We'd love to know
  how well the new poll and kqueue code is working, and if there
  are any issues with it.
- Support for poll() and kqueue() have been added, please comment on
  performance differentials.
- Most static object structures are now described as metadata, please
  comment on how well this transition is working for you.
- PostgreSQL support is starting to freeze. Please note schema changes
  in SQL/atheme_init.sql.
- The build system has been reworked. You may need to use gmake on
  BSD systems. Please comment on any trouble you have had with building
  Atheme (on the tracker, of course.)
- protocol/hyperion supports login session tracking now, please comment
  on how well it is working for you.
- protocol/ratbox support for login sessions has also vastly improved.
- dbtool is most likely broken right now. This is not likely to change
  any time soon.
- The configuration parser has been overhauled. Please report any crashes
  when parsing configurations.
- Channel passwords have been removed.
- Most access checking has been simplified, please make sure it is working
  properly on your network.
- w00t has gone and entirely tokenized the Unreal protocol support. Please
  report any issues with this that you find.
- STATS is now abstracted instead of living in 15 different protocol modules.
- Probably much more that we have missed :)

Atheme 0.2 Release Notes
========================
- Way too many things to note.

Atheme 0.2rc1 Release Notes
========================
- Protocol support has been modularized.
- The configuration format has drastically changed. Please redo your config.
- The core has been modularized. Please provide feedback if something is not
  working as it should.
- Module support has been added. To compile third party modules, add them to
  the modules directory and rerun setup/configure. Any modules in your
  installation's modules/ directory will be automatically loaded at startup.
- Metadata support has been added. To experiment with it, see our wiki
  information on the topic:

  http://wiki.oscnet.org/index.php/Atheme:Experimenting_with_Metadata
- Several NickServ-related bugs have been fixed.
- IRCNet support is marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.

Atheme 0.1 Release Notes
========================

- Dancer/Hyperion IRCd support is marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.
- Chunky Monkey IRCd is also marked as experimental. If you run this ircd,
  please give us feedback on how well it functions.
- NickServ support is experimental. We would like suggestions on how to improve it.
  If you would like to use it, you should use the example-traditional.conf file,
  instead of the example.conf. This will set up a logical environment for NickServ to
  operate in.
- InspIRCd support passes our regression tests, however, we would like feedback
  concerning how well it works. Features added by optional modules are not supported
  at this time. You will need the m_services.so module loaded to make things work
  100% properly.
- UnrealIRCd support is implemented fairly well, but not all features are supported.
- Bahamut 1.8 support has not been tested against 1.8.4, though it is expected that
  1.8.4 should work fine.
- TSora IRCd support (ratbox) does not support TS6, and probably never will.

If you need help, drop by AthemeNet and ask:
  irc.atheme.org #atheme

Thanks!
