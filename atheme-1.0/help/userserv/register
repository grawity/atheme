Command - REGISTER
Usage   - REGISTER <account> <password> <email-address>
  
This will register an account with UserServ. This allows
you to get access to channels more easily and use memos
(if enabled). The password is a case-sensitive password
that you make up. Please write down or memorize your
password! You will need it later to change settings.
  
Examples:
    /msg &nick& REGISTER foo sesame foo@bar.com
