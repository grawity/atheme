  Make it possible for a module init function to indicate failure
  (m->mflags = MODTYPE_FAIL). If this happens the module will be
  unloaded without calling the deinit function.
  Added a macro MODULE_USE_SYMBOL to call module_locate_symbol()
  and abort the module load on failure.
  Other changes: the loaded module is now not in the modules list
  when modinit is called, wallops/log for depending modules unload
  in reverse order.

  We do not mark users as deopped (drop modes from them)
  so this will not work 100% with TS5.

    it takes 7 hits to kill him as his strength/speed gets divided by two each time:
     60 -> 30 -> 15 -> 7 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0 (0.5, but because speed is an int, it becomes 0).

  After discussion with Brain, improve this to avoid topics
  being bounced. Similar to ratbox/charybdis, use FTOPIC
  (ratbox: TB) from the server only to restore old topics
  and use TOPIC from chanserv to set new ones.

  Log:
  Remove the broken nickname linking system.
  
  Rationale:
  
  The implementation doesn't really work right, links basically only
  work for channel access and /ns ghost. Still it complicates things
  quite a lot.
  
  Considering we have identify as, and changing nicks does not log you
  out from services, the only use for nickname linking is allowing
  people to /ns ghost multiple nicks under one account. For that, they
  could also create multiple accounts instead (which requires keeping them
  all in use).
  
  Another argument is that, in practice, many people do not understand how
  linking works, so they don't use it.
  
  So I propose removing nickname linking.
  
  Multiple nicks per account might come back later with a
  ratbox-services-style nickserv (account name has no relationship to
  nicks, account has zero or more nicks associated with it).

  Add per-channel flags templates. Templates can be specified
  in the flags command, avoiding the need to memorize
  complicated flags strings. Templates are manipulated with
  the TEMPLATE command which is similar to the FLAGS command.
  The xOP levels can also be used as templates.
  
  For example: /msg chanserv flags #chan *!*@*.good.com VOP
  
  All template entries must fit in a single metadata entry,
  private:templates. This is fairly ugly string manipulation.
  
  The TEMPLATE command module needs to be enabled in the
  configuration file.

  Our server_t (me.me) and user_t's (service_t.me) are

  do not create or destroy user_t's anymore.
  introduce_nick() takes a uid argument instead of
  modes.
  
  Handling of /kill on services is currently broken.

  - Send channel notices from the server instead of from chanserv if
    chanserv is not on channel, in order that they won't be blocked
  - If chanserv is not on channel, join briefly to set the topic.
    This is annoying but there is really no other way.

  Force users to log in before using NS VERIFY. This is not strictly necessary but helps avoid leaking information about pending authorizations (for example, a user can't see that another user's registration has not been verified or that they have a pending e-mail change).

  Log:
  Don't let users change their e-mail address before they perform the initial verification. Prevents the following attack: malicious user registers evil1 with e-mail address innocent@user.com, uses /NS SET EMAIL evil@evil.com, and then uses the key to verify the initial registration (instead of the subsequent e-mail change). If we add more verification points in the future, we may want to have a 'key type' property.
