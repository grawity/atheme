User modes
----------

The Atheme core knows the following user modes:

+i	invisible, only tracked for use by modules
+o	IRC operator

Some protocol modules recognize additional user modes.

User modes are stored in user_t.flags together with other state information.

Channel modes
-------------

The following types of channel modes exist:

A	ban-like (list)
B	simple, with parameter both when set and unset
C	simple, with parameter only when set
D	simple, no parameter
E	prefix

Modes of type E are characterized both by a letter and by a special
character to be prefixed to a nick (or UID).

The Atheme core knows the following channel modes:

A	+b	channel ban
B	+k	channel key (password)
C	+l	user limit
E	+o (@)	channel operator
E	+v (+)	voice

Protocol modules can define more modes of types A (ircd->ban_like_modes),
C (ignore_mode_list), D (mode_list) and E (status_mode_list,
prefix_mode_list).

The mode_list should contain at least +i, +m, +n, +s and +t with the
standard values.

The Atheme core has special treatment for the following extended channel modes:
A	ban exception		ircd->except_mchar
A	invite exception	ircd->invex_mchar
D	permanent channel	ircd->perm_mode
E	halfop			ircd->uses_halfops, ircd->halfops_mode, ircd->halfops_mchar
E	channel protection	ircd->uses_protect, ircd->protect_mode, ircd->protect_mchar
E	channel founder		ircd->uses_owner, ircd->owner_mode, ircd->owner_mchar

The different types of modes are stored as follows:
A	channel_t.bans
B	channel_t.key
C	channel_t.limit, channel_t.extmodes
D	channel_t.modes
E	chanuser_t.modes

channel_t.key and channel_t.extmodes are smalloc/sstrdup'ed strings and are
NULL if the mode is not set.

Mode locks are stored as follows (only simple modes can be mlocked):
B	mychan_t.mlock_key
C	mychan_t.mlock_limit, mychan_t metadata private:mlockext
D	mychan_t.mlock_on, mychan_t.mlock_off

Key/limit mlocked off are stored as CMODE_KEY/CMODE_LIMIT flags in
mychan_t.mlock_off. Key/limit mlocked on do not use CMODE_KEY/CMODE_LIMIT
flags.

Modes of type D can be marked oper-only with ircd->oper_only_modes. This
prevents users without chan:cmodes privilege from changing those modes in
mode locks. The other modes in the mlock can be changed and the oper-only
modes will remain untouched.

The format of private:mlockext is a space-separated sequence of
<modechar><value>. If the value is empty, that mode is mlocked off. Modes
which are not mentioned are not mlocked. The metadata entry is only present
if any ignore_mode_list modes are mlocked.
