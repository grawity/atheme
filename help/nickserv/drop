Command - DROP
Usage   - DROP <nickname> <password>
  
Using this command makes NickServ stop watching your nick, and
will remove it from services' database. If a nick is dropped,
anyone else can register it. You will also lose all your channel
access and memos. You must use the NickServ IDENTIFY command
before doing this.

When dropping and re-registering a nick during a netsplit, users
on the other side of the split may later be recognized as the
new account.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DROP foo bar
