Help for FREEZE:

FREEZE allows operators to "freeze" an abusive users
nickname. When an operator freezes a nickname, the user
can no longer identify to the nickname. This prevents
any access to be gained.

FREEZE information will be displayed in INFO output.

Syntax: FREEZE <nickname> ON|OFF <reason>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& FREEZE pfish ON Persistent spammer
    /msg &nick& FREEZE alambert OFF
