Syntax - LINK <nickname> [password]

Adds the target nickname as a child nickname of your
primary account. If the nickname is already registered,
you will need to provide the password, please note that 
linking an already linked nickname will result in the
obliteration of any channel access or settings for that
nickname. Therefore, you should be very careful before
linking an already registered nickname.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& LINK moogle
    /msg &nick& LINK l33tnick S0m3El1t3P4S5H3R3
