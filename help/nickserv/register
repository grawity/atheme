Command - REGISTER
Usage   - REGISTER <password> <email-address>
  
This will register your current nickname with NickServ. This
means that only you can have access to this nickname, unless
you give access to others. The password is a case-sensitive
password that you make up. Please write down or memorize
your password! You will need it later to change settings.
  
Examples:
    /msg &nick& REGISTER bar foo@bar.com
